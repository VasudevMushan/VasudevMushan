<p align="left">
Hi, I‚Äôm Vasudev, a dedicated Data Analyst with a strong background in using advanced tools like Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI to drive data-informed decisions. Over the years, I have worked across various industries, particularly in retail and finance, to develop tailored business intelligence solutions that streamline reporting, enhance operational efficiency, and unlock valuable insights.

My project portfolio includes notable contributions such as:

### Store Data Analysis:
Designed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze product performance and customer behavior, leading to optimized decision-making and operational improvements for the retail store.
### Food Delivery App Funnel Analysis: 
Provided key insights into 2019 platform performance by analyzing session data, traffic sources, and conversion metrics. This helped identify order trends and traffic fluctuations, contributing to performance optimization.
### Bank Loan Analysis: 
Built Tableau dashboards for a leading bank, focusing on loan application performance, funded amounts, and regional borrower trends. The insights facilitated better decision-making and enhanced loan processing efficiency.
### Food Delivery Data Analysis Project: 
Conducted a detailed analysis of transaction data, focusing on order distribution and customer lifetime value, which enabled the organisation to improve its home delivery service and enhance customer satisfaction.

I hold a B. Tech in Mechanical Engineering with a strong academic record, and I am AWS Certified as a Cloud Practitioner. Additionally, I‚Äôve earned accolades such as a 5-star SQL badge and a 4-star problem-solving badge on Hackerrank, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and excellence in data analytics.

With expertise in data modeling, manipulation, and visualization, I‚Äôm always eager to collaborate on projects that leverage data to solve complex business challenges and deliver tangible results. Let‚Äôs connect and explore how we can use data to drive business growth!
